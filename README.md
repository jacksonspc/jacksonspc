# Who am I? 

My name is Jackson, I am 14 years old and a person who loves software. I like to write scripts, configure and modify software, and just mess 
around with my computer.

# What do I do?
 
Not much of note, I will have my window manager configs, scripts, and other software things here, but not alot of *good* code, because I'm still learning.

# Software I use

## Window Manager
[dwm](https://suckless.org/)

I have my own configs on Github. It is just amazing. It is configured in python.

## OS 
MacOS Big Sur, because I'm testing it out to see how I like it, but I probably will be back on Linux very soon.

## Editor

[Emacs](https://emacs.org)

A highly configurable free software editor.


## Terminal
[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
Rust and GPU Accelerated.

# Updates:
- Probably moving everything over to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sparkpc) soon
