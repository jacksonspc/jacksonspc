# Who am I? 

My name is Jackson, I am 13 years old and would like to call myself an advanced Linux user. I like to write scripts, configure and modify software, and just mess 
around with my computer.

# What do I do?
 
I write scripts that optimize your computer usage, using Suckless's Dmenu, and other Linux system utillities.

# Software I use

## Window Manager
[Suckless's DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

I have my own build on Github. It is just amazing. It is minimal by default, but you patch it with their [patches](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/).

## Distro
[Artix with Runit](https://artixlinux.org/)

I use Artix With Runit, Runit is an alternative to Systemd, I don't hate Systemd, I just prefer Runit or OpenRC.
Otherwise Artix is just Arch.

## Editor

[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

A terminal editor

It seems to be the best out there. It has all the features I need, and barley any bloat (It isn't electron LOL)

## Terminal
[St](https://st.suckless.org/)

It is also Suckless. It is minimal and I patch it.

# Thank You!
